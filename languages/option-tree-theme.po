"The Typography option type is for adding typography styles to your theme "
"either dynamically via the CSS option type above or manually with %s. The "
"Typography option type has filters that allow you to remove fields or change "
"the defaults. For example, you can filter %s to remove unwanted fields from "
"all Background options or an individual one. You can also filter %s. These "
"filters allow you to fine tune the select lists for your specific needs."

"The Upload option type is used to upload any WordPress supported media. "

"feature. If you import the theme options and have uploaded media on one site "
"the old URI will not reflect the URI of your new site. You will have to re-"
"upload or %s any media to your new server and change the URIs if necessary."
